# Project 1: Regression

Before this project is due we  will have discussed regression with a variety of models including multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, and k-nearest neighbors.

Your assignment is to apply these models to a regression problem.


## Part 1

__Due Tuesday, 2014/08/26__

Find a regression problem that interests you. Many data sets for regression problems can be found at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html?format=&task=reg&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=&sort=nameUp&view=table). You can also browse past [Kaggle.com](http://kaggle.com) competitions. You may also use or collect a different data set if none of these interest you.

Describe the problem, the response variable, and the explanatory variables. How could you represent the explanatory variables as features?

Inspect the data set. Are any of the values of the explanatory variables missing? Calculate descriptive statistics (min, max, mean, etc.) for the variables. Calculate the covariance of the response variable and some of the explanatory variables. Plot the response variable against some of the explanatory variables. What relationships do you observe?

Submit your script(s) as `.ipynb` or `.py` files, data, and a short slide deck in `.pdf` format describing your findings.


## Part 2

__Due Tuesday, 2014/09/04__

Train and evaluate various models using cross validation or a separate test set. Which model performed best? Describe whether the models you trained suffer from high bias, variance, or both. Can you regularize the model? Can you use a more expressive model?

Submit your script(s) as `.ipynb` or `.py` files, data, and a short slide deck in `.pdf` format describing your models.
